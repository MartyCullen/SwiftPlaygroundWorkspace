//*** Structs pass by value and classes pass by reference
//*** Array and Dictionary are STRUCTS and pass by VALUE, so a COPY is passed
//*** Structs are 10k to 1M times faster than classes!

// Structures are value types. By default, the properties of a value type cannot be modified from within its instance methods.
// However, you can optionally allow such modification to occur by declaring the instance methods as â€˜mutatingâ€™; e.g.:



class HumanClass {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {    // THIS CODE IS NEEDED IN THE CLASS (Would not be required for a struct)
        self.name = name
    }
}



// Swift will automatically create an init for you
struct HumanStruct {
    var name: String
    //    init(name: String) {    // THIS CODE IS NOT NEEDED IN THE STRUCT (Would be required for a class)
    //        self.name = name
    //    }
}

let humanClassObjectTwo = humanClassObjectOne  // The two variables now point to the same shared memory space
humanClassObjectTwo.name = "Bobby"             // We are allowed to mutate a property on an immutable object (declared with let)
print(humanClassObjectOne.name) // Now ALSO Bobby

let humanStructObjectOne = HumanStruct(name: "Bob")
let humanStructObjectTwo = humanStructObjectOne   // TWO is now a COPY of ONE
// humanStructObjectTwo.name = "Bobby"            // Cant do this like we could with a class, it is IMMUTABLE becuase the STRUCT is
var humanStructObjectThree = humanStructObjectOne // THREE is also a COPY of ONE, but mutable
humanStructObjectThree.name = "Bobby"
