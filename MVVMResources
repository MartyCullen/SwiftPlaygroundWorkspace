MVVM Designed by Microsoft
Model
   - API, Persistence, Just like MVC
View Model
   - interface between the View and the Model
   - Formats data from model and supplies it to the UI in an easy to use fashion
   - Responds to model changes and updates the UI
   - Responds to UI input and handles getting it to the Model
View
   - UIView, UIViewController (thinned out)
   - On other platorms would use data binding, but not available on iOS
   - Use closures and generics to replace binding
   - Other alternatives are KVO, or reactive
